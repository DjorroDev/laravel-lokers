### Description:

Hi, I am Aufar aka Djorro. In this final project I made a job portal website, Lokers. The project was made by two frameworks. The first one is Laravel since I know a little bit about PHP. And the second framework is bootstrap for the front-end.

## How to install

1. Clone the project

    ```
    Git clone
    ```

2. setup `.env` file
3. run php artisan migrate (add seed to generate data faker)
    ```
    php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
    ```
4. run to localhost
    ```
    php artisan serve
    ```
